    <h1>Sandwich of Death</h1>
    <p><em>"Thousands of years ago, in the most ancient of dojos, the most delicious sandwich in the world entered our
            realm."</em></p>
    <p>Eat it right, or you die.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bbq sauce</li>
        <li>split top sub rolls, cut lengthwise</li>
        <li>Pack of sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>pack of small sliced bacon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Meatballs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g ground beef</li>
        <li>500 g ground turkey</li>
        <li>120 g prosciutto, chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded parmesan</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh italian parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>Pinch of ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350ÂºF. Spray a large baking dish with non-stick spray. In a large bowl, use your hands
            to squish together all of the meatball ingredients until well combined. Roll into balls (about ping pong
            size) & place them in the baking dish in a single layer. Cover with foil & bake for 25-30 minutes or until
            cooked through. Remove the meatballs to a container & discard the juices from the baking tray.
            Alternate cooking method: Place the uncooked meatballs in a greased slow cooker & pour the sauce mixture on
            top. Cook on low for 6-7 hours or high for 3-4, until fully cooked.</li>
        <li>n a medium bowl, stir together the spaghetti or pizza sauce with the BBQ sauce, & then spread the mixture on
            the cut open sub roll. Fold several slices of sandwich pepperoni & Canadian bacon in half & lay them
            alternately across the bottom half of the sub roll. Top with a row of meatballs & optional extra shredded
            parmesan &/or chopped fresh parsley, & then close with the top half of the sub roll. Eat wearing cut-off
            jeans & a mullet and DO NOT LEAVE SANDWICH UNACCOMPANIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.</li>
